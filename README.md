# TripleTen_projects

Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description | Feature techniques |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- | -------------|
| 1 | Project of Yandex.Music| The project task was to compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville and to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities. | Data cleaning and preprocessing |
| 2 | Instacart Project | The project task was to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. | EDA |
| 3 | Statistical Data Analysis | The project task was to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. The data contains 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.| Hypothesis test |
| 4 | Project of Streamlit | The project task was to create and manage Python virtual environments, develop a web application, and deploy it to a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public. | Streamlit, Render |
| 5 | Project of analyzing game data | The project task was to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not and spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. | Data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA |
| 6 | Project of analyzing data and working with a database | The project task was to work with a database. | MySQL |
| 7 | Project of machine learning | The project task was to develop a model that will pick the right plan. | Machine Learning Models |
| 8 | Project of supervised Learning | The project task was to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon | Machine Learning Models, unbalanced data |
| 9 | Project of finding the best well | The project task was to find the best place for a new well. | Machine Learning Models |
| 10 | Gold recover prediction | The project task was to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. | EDA, Machine Learning Models |
| 11 | Project related to Linear Algebra | The project task was to find customers who are similar to a given customer. | EDA, Machine Learning Models, KNN classification |
| 12 | Project of analyzing models | The project task was to train different models with various hyperparameters and analyze the speed and quality of the models. | EDA, Machine Learning Models |
| 13 | Time series project | The project task was to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. | Time series, Machine Learning Models |
| 14 | NLP project | The project task was to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. | NLP |
