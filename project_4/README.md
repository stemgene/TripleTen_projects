# Project description

The focus of this project is to provide you with additional practice with common software engineering tasks. These will augment and complement your data skills, and make you a more attractive job candidate to potential employers.

The tasks are: creating and managing python virtual environments, developing a web application, and deploying it to a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public.

In this project, we are providing you with a dataset you are already familiar with: a dataset of car sales advertisements. However, in this project, the focus will not be on the dataset or the analysis, and thus you are free, and even encouraged, to choose any dataset that you want.
